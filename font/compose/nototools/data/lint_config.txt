# Adobe's position is that these (mathematical) characters are intended to be used with CJK
# in an LTR environment.  For true bidi text (that would naturally trigger bidi) these
# characters should come from a font designed for bidi.  So there is no need in this font
# for the mirrored glyphs.

# typographic ascender. 1.004 patched some glyphs but otherwise behavior is the same.
