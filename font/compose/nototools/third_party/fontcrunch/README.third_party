Description:
fontcrunch is a TrueType outline simplification tool.

Local Modifications:
1. Only the fontcrunch directory is included from fontbakery.

2. .bz and .bzopt files are renamed to .bez and .bezopt to reduce confusion
   with bzip files.

3. Python paths have been modified so fontcrunch.py can run in Noto's build
   environment.

4. fontcrunch.py has been changed to load glyphs in the fonttools recommend
   way.

5. gcc is told to run in C++11 mode to make sure quadopt can build.

6. 'make clean' has been extened to also remove the temporary directories.
